# Multi-class Text Classification using Scikit-learn

## Overview
This repository contains a web application for multi-class text classification, integrated using Python and the Flask framework. The application leverages the Multinomial Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm to classify BBC news articles into five pre-defined categories.

## Features
- **Web Interface:** A user-friendly web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easy interaction.
- **Text Classification:** Classifies news articles into one of five categories:
  1. Technology
  2. Sports
  3. Politics
  4. Business
  5. Entertainment
- **Data Exploration:** Jupyter Notebook used for data exploration, preprocessing, and visualization.
- **Machine Learning:** Implementation of the Multinomial Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm using Scikit-learn.

## Dataset
The classification model is trained on the BBC news dataset, which consists of news articles categorized into the aforementioned classes.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
